\section{Conclusions}

In this work, we consider the problem of using rich \mbox{CRF-based} scene models in Bayesian filtering setting. We presented the rCRF model which uses rich modelling power of CRFs in recursive Bayesian filtering. We further developed a computationally-tractable method based on Jensen inequality and structured diversity. We performed extensive experiments that
%  the proposed method against the state-of-the-art methods and various baselines. We 
show rCRF  accurately anticipates the future beliefs over CRFs. We also experimentally demonstrated that the recursive framework significantly improves the accuracy of anticipation. Our rCRF not only resulted in more accurate anticipation but also improved the computation time.
