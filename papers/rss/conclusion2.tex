\section{Conclusions}
In this work, we consider the problem of using rich \mbox{CRF-based} scene models in Bayesian filtering setting. We presented the rCRF model which uses rich modeling power of CRFs in recursive Bayesian filtering. We further developed a computationally-tractable method based on Jensen inequality and structured diversity. We extensively experimented the proposed method against the state-of-the-art methods and various baselines. We showed that the rCRF can accurately anticipate the future beliefs over CRFs. We also experimentally demonstrated that the recursive framework is necessary for accurate anticipation. Moreover, rCRF not only enables more accurate anticipation but also improves the computation time.
